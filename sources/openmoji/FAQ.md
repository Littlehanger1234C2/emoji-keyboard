‚ö†Ô∏è The colorfont version of OpenMoji is in a very early alpha stage - currently Firefox only - and not intended to use in production! Please follow the [discussion](https://github.com/hfg-gmuend/openmoji/issues/93) for updates.

### ü§î: Is there an "emoji popup" or "emoji picker" available for OpenMoji?

No, we are sorry! This is simply out of scope. (Happy to list working third party solutions here)
